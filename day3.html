<h3>Web Dev Projects</h3>

<p style="color:red" >I have worked on a web project. <br> I have created a simple
 web development project consisting of three HTML pages: an introduction, college details,
 and a project showcase.<br> The website includes a navigation menu for easy access between 
 pages and uses basic CSS for styling. It highlights my education, skills, and internship
 experience, providing a structured and informative layout.</p>
 <hr>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold">Skills:</h3>
<p style="color:purple"> I have developed a variety of skills that allowed me to apply my technical and creative skills in web development.<br>
 In this project, I designed and developed a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, along with basic backend.<br>
The website focused on providing a user-friendly interface,resposive design,and interactive features.  </p>
